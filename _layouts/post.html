To focus my efforts on serving the healthcare cybersecurity community through the <a href="https://cisa.gov">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a>, I will be taking a year off from the <a href="https://villageb.io"Biohacking Village</a>. I’m incredibly thankful for all the support from the community of volunteers, partners, and attendees who have helped bring the [Device Lab](https://www.villageb.io/device-lab) to life over the past several years. The Biohacking Village will continue to manage and run the Device Lab on behalf of and with the support of the healthcare cybersecurity community.

I’m proud and humbled by what the Device Lab has meant to so many people since I launched it with a few borrowed devices in a corner of the IoT Village, in a joint project with I Am The Cavalry and the Biohacking Village 5 years ago. <a href="https://twitter.com/Razzies/status/1292207060998914050">Hackers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BraveBosom/status/1291552988729757697">patients</a>, care givers, and engineers have confided (many privately) that it touched their lives in profound and unexpected ways. They leave feeling empowered by the experience.

I’m also proud and humbled that the <a href="https://video.wixstatic.com/video/4ea6e0_7b62218c1a4b459992d455a2a224fc57/1080p/mp4/file.mp4">Biohacking Village at DEF CON</a> has become a heartbeat of the healthcare and hacking communities. The Device Lab created new norms in the hacker and healthcare communities, set in a high-trust, high-collaboration space. I believe its success stems from an uncompromising focus on empathy, understanding, and openness, which forged a culture where hackers, regulators, and manufacturers feel comfortable addressing uncomfortable topics, with respect for each other. Initiatives like <a href="https://wehearthackers.org/">#WeHeartHackers</a>, the healthcare hacker hiring pipeline, and positive vulnerability reporting show the merit of this approach.

The Device Lab has set the standard that other communities have sought to emulate, including aerospace and elections security. The Device Lab is well developed and supported by the community, so I believe it can continue acting as an inspiration, as organizations increasingly encounter friendly hackers in the years to come.

Over the following year, I will bring the same approach of trust-building, cooperation, empathy, and understanding to the CISA COVID Task Force, I Am The Cavalry, and the CTI League, helping protect national and global health efforts during the pandemic and beyond. I look forward to continuing to serve the healthcare and hacker communities with the Biohacking Village again, for healthier people and healthier tech.
